### JGCRPC
Allows for sending of all standard Jgcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### Looking for Wallet Tools?
JGCRPC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in JGCRPC.py are:

	bitrpc.py walletpassphrasechange
	bitrpc.py walletpassphrase
